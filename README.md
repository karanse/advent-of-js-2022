# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repo tracks my solutions (or maybe only my naive attempts :upside_down_face:) to solve each puzzle with Javascript.
